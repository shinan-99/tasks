        <p> a MERN stack specialist with six months of experience  <br> under my belt. When I'm not slinging code, you can find me binge-watching cat videos on YouTube <br> or trying to perfect my air guitar skills. I believe that the key to success in tech is a healthy dose <br> of humor, which is why I'm always cracking jokes and trying to make my colleagues <br> laugh (sometimes at my own expense). So if you're looking for a developer who's not afraid <br> to bring a little levity to the table, you've come to the right place!</p> <br>
